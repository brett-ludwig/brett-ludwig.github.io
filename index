        <h4>Author: Sara Teasdale</h4>
        <p>
          There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground, <br>
          And swallows circling with their shimmering sound; <br>
          <br>
          And frogs in the pools, singing at night, <br>
          And wild plum trees in tremulous white, <br>
          <br>
          Robins will wear their feathery fire, <br>
          Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire; <br>
          <br>
          And not one will know of the war, not one <br>
          Will care at last when it is done. <br>
          <br>
          Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree, <br>
          If mankind perished utterly; <br>
          <br>
          And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn, <br>
          Would scarcely know that we were gone. <br>
